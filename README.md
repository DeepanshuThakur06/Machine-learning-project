* ### **Introduction**

The stock market is a dynamic environment where investors rely on accurate predictions to make decisions. This project aims to build a predictive model for Yes Bank's stock closing prices, helping investors and analysts gain insights into potential future price movements.

* ### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock data for Yes Bank, including features such as open price, high price, low price, and, most importantly, closing price. This data is essential for training and evaluating regression models.

* ### **Project Goals**

The primary objectives of this capstone project are:
1. To preprocess and prepare the stock data for regression analysis.
2. To perform feature engineering to create relevant features for modeling.
3. To implement and evaluate different regression models for price prediction.
4. To select the best-performing model and provide predictions for Yes Bank's closing prices.

* ### **Methods Used**

**Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data quality. Additionally, we will split the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

**Regression Models:** We will utilize various regression techniques including:
1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
3. Random Forest Regression

**Optimization Techniques:** We will use techniques such as grid search cross-validation (CV) to optimize the hyperparameters of our models.
Model Saving: The best-performing model, i.e., the linear regression model optimized through grid search CV, will be saved to a pickle file for future use.

* ### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this capstone project aims to develop a reliable regression model for predicting Yes Bank's closing prices. By leveraging historical stock data and advanced machine learning techniques, we strive to provide accurate predictions that can assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions.
